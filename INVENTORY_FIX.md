# Inventory Gesture Bug Fix

## Problem Description

When opening inventory with the gesture:
1. Left click gets stuck in "hold" state
2. Actions HUD shows left click is held
3. Exit inventory gesture doesn't trigger
4. After manually exiting inventory with keyboard, left click remains stuck
5. No other actions work despite gestures being recognized

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Incomplete Mode Transition
When entering menu mode, the action coordinator was:
- Releasing specific buttons (left click, right click)
- But NOT using `release_all()` which ensures all inputs are released
- Not properly resetting all state flags (jumping, sprinting, sneaking)

### Issue 2: State Corruption
If a right hand gesture (mining/attack) was active or detected during the transition to menu mode:
- The gesture would still be recognized
- But `_execute_menu_actions()` doesn't handle right hand actions
- The action state never got properly cleared
- Left click could remain held indefinitely

### Issue 3: Menu Exit Gesture Not Working
- Menu close gesture was only handled in gameplay mode's `_handle_left_hand_actions()`
- When in menu mode, `_execute_menu_actions()` is called instead
- The menu close gesture needed to be handled in BOTH places

### Issue 4: No Safety Cleanup in Menu Mode
- While in menu mode, if any gameplay actions were stuck (mining, attack, shield)
- There was no mechanism to detect and release them
- The action coordinator would maintain these stuck states indefinitely

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Mode Entry (`_enter_menu_mode`)
**Before:**
```python
self.controller.stop_moving()
self.controller.release_left_click()
self.controller.release_right_click()
```

**After:**
```python
self.controller.release_all()  # Releases EVERYTHING
# Plus reset ALL state flags
self.is_jumping = False
self.is_sprinting = False
self.is_sneaking = False
```

### 2. Enhanced Mode Exit (`_exit_menu_mode`)
**Before:**
```python
self.controller.tap_key('esc')
```

**After:**
```python
self.controller.release_all()  # Release any stuck inputs FIRST
self.controller.tap_key('esc')  # Then exit menu
# Plus reset ALL state flags
```

### 3. Safety Cleanup in Menu Mode (`_execute_menu_actions`)
Added at the start of menu action execution:
```python
# Safety check: Release any stuck actions from gameplay mode
if self.right_hand_action in ['mining', 'attack', 'placing']:
    self.controller.release_left_click()
    self.controller.release_right_click()
    self.right_hand_action = None

if self.left_hand_action == 'shield':
    self.controller.release_right_click()
    self.left_hand_action = None
```

This runs EVERY frame while in menu mode, ensuring stuck actions get cleared.

### 4. Menu Close Gesture Handling
Added menu close gesture detection in `_execute_menu_actions`:
```python
if menu_hand_action == 'menu_close':
    self._exit_menu_mode()
    return
```

### 5. Debug Logging
Added console logging to track mode transitions:
```python
print(f"[ACTION COORDINATOR] Entering menu mode (open_inventory={open_inventory})")
print("[ACTION COORDINATOR] Exiting menu mode")
print(f"[ACTION COORDINATOR] Inventory gesture detected, entering menu mode")
```

### 6. HUD Mode Display
Added prominent mode indicator at top of HUD:
- Shows "MODE: GAMEPLAY" or "MODE: MENU"
- Cyan color when in menu mode for high visibility
- Black background for clarity

## How to Use

### Testing the Fix
1. **Open inventory**: Use the inventory gesture
   - Watch console for: `[ACTION COORDINATOR] Entering menu mode`
   - HUD should show: `MODE: MENU` in cyan
   - All actions should release immediately

2. **Close inventory**: Use the menu close gesture
   - Watch console for: `[ACTION COORDINATOR] Exiting menu mode`
   - HUD should show: `MODE: GAMEPLAY`
   - Should be able to perform actions again

3. **Stuck state recovery**: If anything gets stuck:
   - Press 'R' to disable gestures (releases all)
   - Press 'R' again to enable gestures

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Opening inventory doesn't cause stuck left click
- [ ] HUD shows correct mode (MENU vs GAMEPLAY)
- [ ] Exit inventory gesture works properly
- [ ] After exiting inventory, all gestures work normally
- [ ] Console shows proper mode transition messages
- [ ] Actions list in HUD clears when entering menu

## Technical Details

### Mode System
The action coordinator has two execution modes:

**Gameplay Mode:**
- Executes: `_execute_gameplay_actions()`
- Handles: movement, jumping, mining, attacking, shield, placing
- Inventory gesture switches to menu mode

**Menu Mode:**
- Executes: `_execute_menu_actions()`
- Handles: cursor control, menu navigation, mode switches
- Menu close gesture switches back to gameplay mode
- Safety cleanup runs every frame to release stuck actions

### State Management
All mode transitions now:
1. Call `release_all()` first
2. Reset all boolean flags (jumping, sprinting, sneaking)
3. Clear all action states (left_hand_action, right_hand_action)
4. Only THEN perform the mode-specific action (open inventory, press ESC)

This ensures no state corruption or stuck inputs.

## Files Modified
1. `utils/action_coordinator.py` - Fixed mode transitions and added safety cleanup
2. `main.py` - Added MODE display to HUD

## Additional Safety Features
- Safety cleanup runs every frame in menu mode
- All mode transitions use `release_all()`
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Visual mode indicator on HUD
- Menu close gesture works from both modes
